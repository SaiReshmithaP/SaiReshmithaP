## 💫 About Me  
🎓 Final Year B.Tech CSE student at GVPCE(A) — Currently in that thrilling "final lap" of engineering life, where every line of code is either a bug or a breakthrough.  

🐛 Debugging my way through life — One semicolon at a time.  
💡 Fun Fact: My Stack Overflow search history is more dramatic than my browser history.  
🎶 If not debugging, you’ll find me humming my favorite tunes!
